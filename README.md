# Student Record Manager (C) 📚

A simple console-based system for managing student records using C. This project simulates basic database functionality using local text files for storage.

It supports adding, updating, and viewing student information through a basic menu-driven interface — designed to improve understanding of file handling and user interaction in C.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Allows user to add student records (name, grades, etc.)
- Stores and reads data from structured `.txt` files
- Provides sorting or ranking of students by average grade
- Menu-driven CLI interface (no external libraries)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- C programming language  
- Standard C libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`  
- File I/O with `.txt` files
